# Rendered example plots

The `*_dark.png` / `*_light.png` files in this directory are **generated** from
the plot-enabled example programs (SkigenPlot / Qt-RHI) and are **git-ignored**
— they are produced on the fly by the website CI/CD build (and can be produced
locally), never committed. Only this `README.md` is tracked.

## Regenerating

On a machine with a working SkigenPlot (Qt 6 + RHI) runtime, point CMake at the
Qt prefix and build the render target:

```bash
cmake -B build-plot -DSKIGEN_BUILD_EXAMPLES=ON -DSKIGEN_WITH_PLOT=ON \
      -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/path/to/Qt/6.11.1/macos   # e.g. ~/Qt/6.11.1/macos
cmake --build build-plot --target skigen_render_example_plots
```

Each example registered via `skigen_enable_plot(<target> <stem>)` in
`examples/CMakeLists.txt` writes `<stem>_dark.png` and `<stem>_light.png`
here. Currently registered: `kmeans`, `tsne`, `pca_clustering`.

The website CI (`.github/workflows/{staging,main}.yml`) runs this same target
(with mne-cpp pre-built Qt 6.11.1 under `xvfb`) right before `npm run build`,
so the published site always has fresh figures without committing binaries.

## Referencing from a guide page

Use Docusaurus `ThemedImage` so the figure follows the site's light/dark mode:

```mdx
import ThemedImage from '@theme/ThemedImage';

<ThemedImage
  alt="KMeans clusters rendered with SkigenPlot"
  sources={{
    light: '/img/examples/kmeans_light.png',
    dark: '/img/examples/kmeans_dark.png',
  }}
/>
```

Add the reference to a guide page only once the corresponding PNGs have been
generated and committed, so the published site never links a missing image.
